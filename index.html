        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Cristobal Olguin" width="200">
        <p>Hello! My name is Cristobal Olguin, I was born in Santiago, Chile, but I grow up in Curacavi, it is an small town about 1.5 hrs from Santiago going north in direction of other popular cities as Valparaiso and Vina del Mar, I used to live with my mom, dad and younger sister, they are not members of The Church Of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints but they always support me when I decided to join the church, get baptized.I love to play piano because one day at church I saw a brother that was visiting my ward in Curacavi that played the piano because my ward did not have a pianist, after the sacrament meeting I went to ask him about how and when He learned to play the piano because in that time I started to develop a desire to learn but I did not belived that was possible because I had a poor mindset about of learning properly during your childhood to be able to achieve it but He told me that He learned after 40 years old so I was so surprised of knowing that and I started to have hope in the chances to learn piano. I asked my parents if was possible for Christmass of that year to get a keyboard to start practicing, they did it, after that I learned through computer programs like Synthesia that uses Midi files to represent every music note on a digital piano so I was able to imitate every note to learn a music that I liked, during my mission I gain more experience because I did not know how to read music and I wanted to play piano at the sacrament meeting in most of the ward that I served during my mission in Brazil. I love to watch and play soccer and go to the gym to lift weights </p>
